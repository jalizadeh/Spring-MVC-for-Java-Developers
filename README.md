## Spring MVC Java Configuration
- [3] Project `Spring MVC Foundation` is configured
- [4] Logging dependencies added
- [5] `AppInitializer` & `WebConfig` is done.
	- Go to `http://localhost:8080/spring-mvc-foundation/main/` to see the message. The 1st webapp is done :)
- [6] `DispatcherInitializer` is used instead of `AppInitializer`
	- It is faster to configure & needs less to code
- [7] Context Heirarchies
	- `RootConfig` is added
	- Sub-packages `services` & `controllers` were added
- [8] View Resolution Configuration
	- `WebConfig` manages how to load `jsp` pages
	- `hello.jsp` holds the beautified `${message}`
	- `MainController` will send the message as `message`

## Boot Configuration
- [2] Boot Basics
	- Project `spring-mvc-boot` is configured. It is a `Spring Starter Project`
	- To see the message, go to `http://localhost:8080/main/`

- [3] Configuration Overrides
	- `/spring-mvc-boot/src/main/resources/application.properties` is used for overriding my own configurations
		```
		server.port=9090
		server.servlet.context-path=/simple
		logging.level.root=debug
		```
	- To see the message, go to `http://localhost:9090/simple/main/`
	

- [4] Thymeleaf Template Engine
	- It will load the `.html` files in `/spring-mvc-boot/src/main/resources/templates`
	- `application.properties` is reset to empty
